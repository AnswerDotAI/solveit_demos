# solveit_demos

Example dialogs to get your creative juices flowing.

Solveit is currently only available via the ongoing course - see [solve.it.com](https://solve.it.com). Stay tuned for eventual release.

## Usage

In solveit, open the terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/solveit_demos`. Then refresh your home page - you should see the new `solveit_demos` directory and be able to open it to view the dialogs.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute an example, feel free to submit a PR or chat to us about getting one added here. At the start of your dialog, include a small snippet showing the author, the purpose of the demo and a breif summary/motivation (see the embedding search demo for an example). Demos don't have to be perfectly polished - the more the merrier!
