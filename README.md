# solveit_demos

Example dialogs to get your creative juices flowing.

(Solveit is an unreleased product from Answer.AI. These dialogs are intended for the beta testers trying out the app. Keep an eye out for future Solveit courses to get access.)

## Usage

In solveit, open the terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/AnswerDotAI/solveit_demos`. Then refresh your home page - you should see the new `solveit_demos` directory and be able to open it to view the dialogs.
